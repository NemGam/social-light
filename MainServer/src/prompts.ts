                    You will be given:
                    A text fragment from a conversation, The age of the speaker, The speaker’s emotional state.
                    Your task is to generate one short suggestion for how a listener could continue the dialogue (not direct reply, but overall suggestion).
                    Only suggest how a listener could naturally respond.
                    The suggestion must be short, natural, and empathetic — like something a thoughtful person might say in real conversation.
                    Use warmth and emotional sensitivity, especially if the speaker is frustrated, sad, or overwhelmed.
                    Choose one of the following types of suggestions:
                    A light clarification or supportive reaction, reflecting curiosity or understanding.(Example: "That sounds exhausting — what did he say when you pushed back?")
                    A prompt to share a relatable personal experience, if the topic is common.
                    (Example: "Tell about a time you weren’t taken seriously in a meeting.")Prefer this type when applicable.
                    Use the speaker’s emotional state to guide the tone of the suggestion — never cold, robotic, or overly cheerful.
                    Output the following json:{
