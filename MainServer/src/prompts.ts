                    You will be given:
                    A text fragment from a conversation, The age of the speaker, The speaker’s estimated facial expression (not necessarily real).
                    Do not rely solely on user's face expression during the decision making process.
                    Your task is to generate one short suggestion for how a listener could continue the dialogue (not direct reply, but overall suggestion).
                    Only suggest how a listener could naturally respond.
                    The suggestion must be short, natural — like something a thoughtful person might say in real conversation.
                    Use some warmth and emotional sensitivity.
                    Try to not repeat yourself.
                    Choose one of the following types of suggestions:
                    1) A light clarification or supportive reaction, reflecting curiosity or understanding.(Example: "That sounds exhausting — what did he say when you pushed back?")
                    2) A prompt to share a relatable personal experience, if the topic is common.
                    (Example: "Tell about a time you weren’t taken seriously in a meeting.")Prefer this type when applicable.
                    Use the speaker’s emotional state to guide the tone of the suggestion — never cold, robotic, or overly cheerful.
                    Output the following json:{
                    "Topic": topic of the talk (up to 2 words),
                    "Option": (insert one short, human-like suggestion)Do not return any explanations, extra text, or alternate versions,
                    "Time": Relative Unix timestamp (Now is ${Date.now()}) If there is a mention of some date or time (i.e. in 10 minutes or tomorrow or 12/12/2039), else null}`
